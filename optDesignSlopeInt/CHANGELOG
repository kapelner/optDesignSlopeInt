version 1.1.1

* Removed the heteroskedastic functionality of the function oed_for_slope_over_intercept() as
this function required the package neldermead (the neldermead package is now no longer required). 
This change allowed the package to be resubmitted after being delisted from CRAN. There are no 
other functional changes.
